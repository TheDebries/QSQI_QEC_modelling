# Repository for student group 3 of the QSQI minor research project

## Overview

This repository contains all code relevant for the QSQI research project. All code was written in Python using the QISKIT package, and was largely written for the purpose of obtaining graphical representations of generated data. This data was used to evaluate the engineered model of the IBM QX Melbourne system to assess its accuraccy, followed by altering the parameters of the system to assess the improvements required for useful application of quantum error correcting codes such as Shor's algorithm or its LNN equivalent.
